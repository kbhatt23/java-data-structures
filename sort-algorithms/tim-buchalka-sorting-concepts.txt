- Data structure is a logical structure of data that helps in hanlding data in better way
- Algorithm are the series of steps depending upon usage that can solve the problem
- D.S and Algo are used in combination to handle complex business logic

-Arrays are good use case when we wnat to get a random indexed value -> time complexity is O(1)
	-> where as in linked list it is still O(n)
-Time complexity is a way to find the performance wothout considering the hardware in an objective/logical manner
- As Same algo will behave differently in different processors ,so this is very useful 
O(n) -> also called linear time complexity -> a simple for/while loop
O(1) - >constant -> a single line of execution outside for loop
O(log n)-> logarithtic -> log to base2
O(n2) -> Quadratic- > a for loop inside another for loop
O(n logn) 

Arrays are continguos blocks in memeory(one after the other -> sequential addresed)
At creation we specify the size so that JVM allocates that block of memory for arry
If we increase the size by creating new array it is not neccessary that it will attach to existing block of memory
- each item in array blocks will have same memory size
	-> for example int array will have each index memory be 4 bytes or 32 bits
- Any object reference variable stores the memory address of the object
- Same for array a refernece variable stores memmory address of first index and hence indices starts with 0 in arrays
- Array allpows random access at any index with O(1) constant time completxity
If x is the address fo 0th index
- we know that all other indxes are continuous in memory
lets say size of each ele,mnmt is y
so memory of any index wil be x + index*y whihc is o(1) time complexity
eg for integer each elmetn will have size as 4 bytes or 32 bit

================bubble sort================
- have a single for loop comparing indexes one by one and do swap if needed
- on first iteration largest elment will go at the end
- we need to do it size-1 times as each iteration is making the largest item push to right
Stable Sort - it maintains the original order in case two numbers are equal _> whatever was leftost will remain on the left
time complexity -> O(n2 -> quadratic)

==============selection sort==================
Type of greedy algo
this is the basic double for loop and j-i+1 sorting i learnt
Every iteration we pick the smallest number and keep at 0 index and increase the index and so on
time complexity -> O(n)
unstable stable sorting technique ->
performs better than bubble sort as swapping is less

========Merge Sort=========
- type of divide and conquer
- O(nlogn) time complexity
- stable sort
- uses recursion
- merge sort uses memory on each of the two sized array and so on

Even better can be Quick sory 
- follows divide and conquer using recursion
- time complexity is O(nlong n)
- no new space is needed as no new temp array is created.
- Quick sort is implemented in concept of pivot- > a number whihc have all the numbers greater than it on the right(might be unsorted) and lower on the left
- We first find pivot of main array and then divide and conquer left and right subarrays until array have 1 size(no need to do anything as for 1 sized array it is at )
- Unstable algorithm

============Count Method===============
- Based on assumption that we know the range of values that array will hold
- this cal help to get time complexity t O(n) leve but is not very powerful
- can be used in case of known ranges and also the range should not be very huge
- cna be used for positive integers only and can not be used for float-	
	-> becuae we use a temp array whose index represent the number in main array and value reprsent the count
	-> since array can not have negative index and index in fractions theis can nt be used for negative numbers and floating data types of array to be sorted
	-> also should not be used for an array having huge range of values as size of temp array will be huge and a lot of temp array's index will remain unused
	-> even for huge range we can still use it in case a lot of different and disrtibuted values are there so that temp array's most of the index remains useful
- can be done for 0 also but as of now we have assumed non zero number in main array to be sorted

if main array is like : [4, 7, 3, 2, 8, 10, 6, 7, 1, 10]
temp array will be like: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2]
By default this is not stable sort but we can make it stable using Map or other D.S

===========Radix Sort==============
- Can be used in radix and width of array elements are same
- Radix means data type is same and widht mean size of individual elements of array
good example : 3172,1235,3212,4739,4533 but this one is not good -> 3172,333,23,11

-- Java OOB uses double pivot sort -> extension of quick sort with 2 pivots instead of 1
