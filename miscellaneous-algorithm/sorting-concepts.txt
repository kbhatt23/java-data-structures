Sorting is rearrangment of things in order of ascending or descending
In objects it uses compareto method to handle ordering
2 types of sorting:
a. spacious : meaning the kind of sort which needs extra space than the array
b. non spacious: sorting technique which do not need extra space other than array
c. stable: in case two entries are equal the actual ordering of main array is maintained.
	-> this is quite useful in case of array of objects like person
d. non stable: in case two objects are equal , after sort the order is not maintained

Stable : means after sorting equeal items will have same order as in main array

bubble sort: lets swap current index to next index in case next is smaller and repeat this until length-2 times

selection sort : take minimum from main array and copy to specific index in another array


				time complexity:               behaviour                         space complexity

bubble sort        O(n2)                   stable & no need of extra memory             O(1)
selection sort      O(n2)                   stable& need memory                        O(n2)
insertion sort       O(n2)                   non stable                              O(1)
bucket sort         O(n logn)/ O(n2)         stable can be used in multi thread       O(n)
