Stack is a logical Data structure meaning it do not actually hold data but uses 
array , or linked list to hoold data, it just provide contract of usage

stack is like a bucket following LIFO -> last in first out prinicple
data whihc comes first gets loaded at the bottom, newer data comes at top and so on
we can pop out data whihc is at top and then so on

This can be used in browser back button functionlaity
supoese we opended facebook -> google.com -> youtube,ocm -> instagram

so it floowls LIFO

\\
  |instagram      | -> top of stack
  |youtube
  |google
  |facbook   -? bottom of stack
  |
  
Each push rolls down thte top element to bottom and new element beocmes top
each pop takes out element at top and removes it
-> In stack we can not remove item at any position before remoing all other elmenents present before it
meaning elements which were before it in the stack top
operations that can be performmed on stack:
a. push -> data insertion at top
b. pop -> data out from top
c peek -> data fetch but not removed from top
d. isEmpty() -> is stack empty
e. isFull -> is stack full
f. size: size of stack


Keep in mind arrays can not have negative size , but 0 and other positive vlaues will hold
-> for 0 size array insertion on 0 index will cause arrayindex out of bound exception

We should use stack only in case we want LIFO operation like back button functionlaity in browser
Since in this addition of item happens only on stack top and peek/pop happens only on stack top
random access/element random serach is not good use case as it has to remove data from stack top until that element is found
