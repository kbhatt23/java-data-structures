A tree is a data structure that represents heirachical structure
Follows parent child relationship
It is a non linear DS (one element can have more than one next element)
It is logical DS(meaining it uses physical DS like array/ linked list to store data)

In tree a node can have more than once child node and that child node can not have child as parent node
Meaning reverse tracking not posiibl in tree like general parent child relationship

why we need tree
array have good time capacity but linked list have same time complezxity
with better space complexity(O(1)) as compared to array creation O(n)

But if we want to enhance the search node capcaity from O(n) to O(log n) -> like we did in binary search of arrays
we need tree basically binary search tree

A tree node can have 0 to n number of child nodes
Binary tree can have 0-2 number of child nodes at any level
BST is a binary tree where left node is less and right is greater than main node

Tree terminology

Root: A node which do not have parent
Edge:  Connection from parent to any child node
leaf: A node which do not have child at all (last node)
sibling : a node having same parent node
ancestor : any node whihc is parent/grandparent /great grandparent etc, but differnet heirachy is ignored.
Depth of node: means number of edges from root node to that node
height of node: number of edges from that node to deepest node among child of that node
depth of tree: means depth of root node -> always 0
height of tree: height of root node
 
 
 Recursion vs for loop
 in recursion time compleezity is O(n) and since method stack is loaded n times at workjst case space complexity is O(n)
 in loop time complexity is O(n) but sopace complexity is O(1)
 
 Tree traversal:
 preorder -> print node -> recurisve(left) -> recursive right
 inorder -> recursive(left)-> print node -> recursive rihgt
 postorder -> recurisve(left) -> recursive(right) -> print node
 for all of above space complezity is O(n) becuase of stack loading in recursion and time complezity is O(n)
 
 Deleting a node have following steps


Finding the deepest node -> we shud do level order traversiong (using queue) and last one is deepest
we shud copy the value of deep node and put in node to be deleted
then remove linking/edge of second deepest node to deepest node in tree 

Predecessor means node just before a node while traversing in in-order traversal 
sucessor means node just after a node while traersing in in-order traversal
deepest node means the last element found in level order traversal
