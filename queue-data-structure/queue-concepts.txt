Queue is a linear data structure(one elment have next elmenet as only one other element)
Queue is a logical Data structure (meaning it do not store data ,it orchestracte data in physical DS)
Queue uses physical DS like array or linked list for implementaiton
and it provides orchestration methods.

Queue follows FIFO prinicple
meaning whoever comes first will be taken out first.
Any element when added goes to last item
Item at the first position is taken out when requested

Queue have trhee types
a.. using arrays circular queue
b. using arrays : linear queue
c. using linked list : no need of circular queue
linked list one has dynamic size

Just like stack queue also do not allow random access of numbers
unless we dequeu the first elment and go till the elment we need we do not have other way
This makes data incorruptible
