Divide and conquer is a programming paradigm in whihc we break down a big problem recursively
-> until the smallest unit is solvable and so on we solve all the smaller units and combine them to ultimately solve the big problem
- The smaller units should be similiar in nature just like recursion
- Do not use this in case the smaller units behave differently

eg: fibonacci series, binary serach, merge sort etc

Dynamic pprogramming is an extension of divide and conquer
In divide and conquer at any step the solution's poart is not fixed
so we break the big problem into smaller recurvice problems 
	-> can be used using recursion
In dynamic programmin we store the solution of any subproblem
 -> so that if that repeats in future instead of calculating we can just use that and save time	
 
 Dynamic programming can not be used in case when subproblem is never repeated io recursion
